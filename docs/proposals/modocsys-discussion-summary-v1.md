# Modern Semantic Documentation System: Project Summary & Key Concepts

## Project Summary

We are considering an incremental migration of our SPD and internal documentation workflows to a modern, semantic, AI-ready platform. The goal is to future-proof compliance, versioning, amendments, and auditability, while making day-to-day staff use easier and enabling automation and advanced analytics in the future.

## Key Concepts

- **Semantic Markup:** All documents (SPDs, amendments, policies) are stored as machine-readable, interlinked data (RDF/OWL/PROV-O), not just static PDFs or Word files.
- **Delta Amendments:** Amendments are stored as "deltas"—atomic changes that reference the original template and prior amendments, with full provenance (who/when/why).
- **Traceability & Provenance:** Every change is logged with context, enabling "time travel" through document history and easy compliance/audit reporting.
- **Web UI for Staff:** Users interact with a simple web interface, not raw markup. Upload/edit docs, generate amendments, see history, and work with familiar workflows.
- **Incremental Adoption:** Start with a pilot (one SPD, one policy, one process), then expand. No "big bang" migration—legacy systems run in parallel.
- **Automation & AI-ready:** The semantic structure enables future AI automation (e.g., compliance checks, Q&A, document generation) and analytics.
- **Integration:** Platform is modular and API-driven, ready to integrate with claims, HR, and other systems.

## Immediate Benefits

- Faster claims/client response
- Reduced manual errors
- Easier audits and compliance
- Version history and rollback
- Future-proof for AI/automation

## Next Steps

1. Draft pilot plan for new line of business
2. Build stakeholder Q&A
3. Propose incremental rollout and change management
